> **WARNING**
> The project is not even under developmentâ€”it is far from being called a "project." Currently, it is more like a "fancy, unreasonably expensive camera with an unhandy UI" rather than the planned product.
> The code is subpar, the idea is flawed; do not judge, as we had deadlines to meet.

# **LiveBoard**

An embedding development educational project

---

LiveBoard is a program supposed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a webcam or any similar setup. It provides a stream of the whiteboard (at least while you point the camera at it), with reduced noise, a precisely captured frame of the board, and unwanted objects removed. Its main feature is the ability to save a single screenshot of your whiteboard as a high-quality SVG image, ideally ready for vector picture editing.
